C0012,Dominic Fernandes,P0012,BarbequeNation,"Dear Team Barbeque Nation,  
I recently had the pleasure of dining at your Kurla Phoenix Market City outlet on 27th November, and I must say, the experience was absolutely fantastic! In fact, were already planning our next visit!  The food was truly exceptional. The mutton was perfectly cooked - soft, tender, juicy, and spiced to perfection. The prawns were customized exactly to our preferred level of spiciness, making every bite a delight.  
A special shoutout to Ajith, Brijesh, and Pappu, who went above and beyond to ensure a seamless experience for my family. They anticipated my parents needs and brought everything directly to our table, allowing them to enjoy the meal without any inconvenience.  
Both the food and the service were impeccable, and we left with happy hearts and full stomachs.  
I do have one small suggestion: If Caramel Custard could be added to the dessert options, it would make our next visit even more irresistible.  
A big thank you to the entire team and the chefs for crafting such a memorable dining experience. Youve truly mastered the art of pampering your guests and catering to their taste buds.  
Looking forward to our next visit soon!

They said ma'am l can customise the things but all went in vain. The white sauce pasta was devoid of any taste. I can cook a better pasta than their chef. The chilli garlic noodles was without and chilly and garlic. The malai kulfi and kesar kulfi also lacked flavours. The brownie was too dry unlike a brownie last but not the least the restaurant had not some of the items it had in the menu. Not only that, l asked the restaurant staff to lessen the temperature of the AC and they did not look into that as well. All the time we were seated in a less cooler zone of the restaurant. The service also was not prompt. We had to ask for few things time and again.

C0021,Washim Baulum,P0021,BarbequeNation,"I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the service my family and I received at your Kohinoor Square location recently. Note that I do not reside in India, im from Mauritius. The level of service we encountered was not only poor but also left us questioning the professionalism of your staff.
Upon our arrival at Kohinoor Square Barbeque Nation, we were excited to enjoy a meal at one of our favorite restaurants. However, our excitement quickly turned into frustration as we were left waiting for more than 25 minutes without any server coming to our table. To make matters worse, another group of guests who arrived after us were promptly assisted while we continued to be ignored. It is deeply concerning to us that we were subjected to such neglect, and we couldnt help but wonder if this treatment had anything to do with my sister wearing a hijab. Discrimination of any kind is entirely unacceptable and goes against the principles of inclusivity and equal treatment that should be upheld by any reputable establishment.
When my wife finally approached the manager to address our concerns, we were met with a perplexed and disinterested response. This lack of empathy and willingness to assist only added to our frustration.We had always held Barbeque Nation in high regard for its excellent food and service, but this experience has shattered our expectations. We could never have imagined receiving such terrible service from a company with your reputation.I strongly believe that this incident should not be taken lightly, and I am inclined to share my experience on social media to ensure that others are aware of the subpar service we encountered at Kohinoor Square Barbeque Nation.I urge you to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate actions to ensure that such incidents do not recur in the future. Your swift response and corrective measures will be crucial in restoring our faith in your brand.

Barbeque Nation  brought the servers / waiters from North East and they seem to be not properly oriented . The guy who served us lacks basic serving manners. He put triple layers of skewers over the fire grill one top of the other . Just tried to pour entire portion on the plate . He was not understanding what we intend to say though we properly explained him in Hindi. Think the Chef is new or changed . He doesn't know to prepare stirr , fried vegetables and Garlic roti . We requested him to prepare thick and thin roti but it was thick and shapeless. He doesn't have the inclination to satisfy customer needs. Lemon soda was made from syrup, not real lemon . Most of the items were tasteless except Malai Kulfi . Pastry items were not good in taste . It's a waste of money here . Considering all these we requested for a discount but supervisor was not in a position to listen and trying to tell his own story which was not understandable.. His communication is too poor. Barbeque Nation  try to cut cost in all aspects even with the quality of staff. Felt like had food in a cheap barbeque restaurant . It really lost it's charm. Expectation failed .

I booked table for 15 persons by calling. They reserved a table as said by me. We reached the restaurant around 8:15 PM. We had poorest experience at the restaurant. First of all, we were not served anything to eat for about half an hour. After a long time waiter severe us with bottles of water. When asked for cold water, it took around 15-20 minutes to bring the bottles. When We asked for glasses we were told that the glasses are being wiped. After repeatedly asking for glasses,we somehow managed to get 3-4 of them, but all glasses were dirty and the most annoying fact was that all the glasses that we got were of different shapes and sizes ( doesn't matter much but still we expect a restaurant like barbeque Nation to maintain uniformity). Now coming to the snacks. Only one waiter was serving 12 of us. We weren't served all snacks. We were on our toes throughout the party, reminding the manager that we are not being served all the snacks. When asked for tomato sauce, the waiter took around 15 minutes to arrange it. By this time also we weren't served glasses for water. The soup being served there was pathetic. After having main course when we asked the manager about the reason of bad service on part of restaurant, he told that the are short of waiters.

Our booking was confirmed and we had got multiple confirmation calls. We reached the venue at 1.55 PM and were told we had to wait for 15 minutes, which was OK. We could not get a table till 3.45 PM and had to return without having food. Worse is their unprofessional, dishonest, and disgusting management. Your coordinator, Mr. Anil Singh, and manager, Mr. Bihanga Bishwas, were rude and had no sense of how to talk to customers. More pathetic was the circle manager, Mr. Vivek Purohit. ""We can't help you. Please cancel your booking,"" he replied. We were made to stand in an open area when it was 35 degrees outside your roof top dining area. The staff were so displeased that they didn't even serve water when demanded multiple times. 
Finally, after a heated argument with the staff, they offered us outside seating at 3.40 PM (in a 35 degree temperature), which we had to decline.

There was no one to assist us. 

We had to literally beg the helpers to clear our tables so that we could make space for the dinner. When no one came to help us, we carried our own used plates and put it on the shelves.

There was no extra spoons available. We had to eat with  our fingers.

There were no bowls available at the dinner counter. I searched for it myself and got some from a cupboard under the counter

l love the barbeque nation  brand, I really do, which is why I will continue to use it despite a series of unfortunate incidents over last night's dinner .

 I imagine the same questions are racing through your brilliant mind as were racing through mine on that fateful day. What is this? Why have I been given it? What have I done to deserve this? And, which one of the staff will help me out .Owing to the very poor service that I received on the 14th  of february  at one of your restaurants,  I wish to air my complaints. we're  unhappy on Valentine's Day with the staffs attitude and overall ambiance around it .

 Firstly, the staff portrayed a large amount of incompetence and a bad attitude towards customers. No one attended to us from 8.10 till .943 pm . When someone  finally came, they  showed a severe lack of interest. A petty situation where my 3 years kid was asking me now and then  is uncle punishing us by making us sit in the corner.    What made matters worse was that after waiting for so long we were given the bad news that nothing can happen and we must lead our way home dear au dear valentine waiting that was for 1.43 mini   .

Finally after an argument we were let in and and the journey started  I LOVED SEEKH KABAB  BUT IT NEVER CAME BACK  and many zero spicy for kids was delayed .

 with a cool head after the event we ordered a mocktail pina colada ohh dear the white drink came without a garnish and a basick straw to gulp it , which was picked up but never return to table for a while only when my voice was echoed it appeared on the table this time with straw and a garnish of pineapple.well it felt like we were let in to see how bowls were empty at end .

ohh dear only a husband can know what comes to him after a destroyed valentine evening at BBQ.??????????????

As I said at the start I love your brand, I really do. Its just a shame such a simple thing could bring it crashing to its knees and begging for sustenance.

C0085,Maninder Sarao,P0085,BarbequeNation,"Hello Barbeque Nation,

Happy New Year first of all and have a great year ahead. I have been a regular customer of your City Emporium Branch, industrial area phase 1, Chandigarh. I booked a table at the same location on 31st dec 2021 @7:00PM and visited with my family. But this time the amount paid per head doesn't feel worth. Let me explain. 

It has been 750+ taxes for each person from day 1 i visited you guys. But this time items were not even half of what i used to get earlier. 

--> No drinks (mocktails), 
--> only two starters (salsa and kebab), 
--> no capsicum with paneer and mushroom on grill sticks, 
--> variety of salad was less in dinner, 
--> only dal and paneer in main course
--> just two flavor in live kulfi section in sweet dishes
--> only 2 type of cake slices

Items missing as i used to get earlier -->
gol gappa, dim sum, dahi ke sholay, salads, chickpeas sabzi, kofta sabzi, egg curry, 8 flavors of live kulfi, no sprinkles on live kulfi, hot jalebi with rabri, hot brownie, mocktails (i know these are charged extra but atleast should be available).

Apart from this Quality was good but taste levels has dropped severely. Level of spiciness increased and there were not enough sausages on the table. Brush flavours missing for grilled items. 

Special Order -- I ordered Cinnamon Pineapple, i love it and have ordered every time i visited but again the taste disappointed me, it was not even cooked properly

Special Request -- It was the birthday of the newly born + new year party for my family,  I mentioned it while booking the table also but no cake celebration. My heart broke with this one when one of the guy said it cannot be done because of new year and heavy rush orders.

Service was upto the mark as always it used to be and was overwhelmed the way they were handling the crowd on that busy day. So heads off to the serving guys.

This was the worst visit I have ever done with Barbeque Nation. Being a regular customer doesn't want the barbeque nation to drop its level so felt this to mention. I hope you guys will bring the flavor back.

We booked a 8:30pm slot yest 18/10/21 at BN Kochin ,we reached the place on time , we were 6 adults and 3 kids , we were welcomed by huge crowd outside the restaurant , they were arguing with the manager to get inside the place , when we reached the manager , he wrote our name down under a long list of names and said he will call us, I got furious if that was the case, then what is the point of all these fancy app and booking your slot and all , after few more arguments with the manager like rest of the crowd did, we entered the restaurant at 9:20 pm, by then the kids were already very hungry and restless.

Part - 2

We went in expecting our superb bad experience will get better once we get our food , but it wasnt to be, the Barbeque items were served after 15 mins , that too very little portion, kids were hungry so I thought while the next round Barbeque comes , we will get some soup for kids, when we went to the buffet counter , there were no soup bowls and cutleries, little tomato soup was left but the manchow soup was finished , other main course items were also of same situation, then I went to the salad counter, the situation was even worse , I took corn salad and it was having a foul smell as if it has gone bad, that triggered me and I asked for the manager , but no one showed up , finally I asked my family to walk out of the place , and we left.

We were a big fan of the place, but that is history now, strict warning for others who want to visit the place, Many more negatives are there but I dont want to waste my time on this.",neutral,0.5
C0089,Dg Mou,P0089,BarbequeNation,"This is how you deliver on time 
All lies 
recent order placed on Barbeque nation ,Indiranagar(Bangalore).

Describing the issue in details 

On the evening of 15th October ,that was my birthday, my husband placed an order on Barbecue Nations website at 6:59pm. Barbecue Nation Indiranagar accepted the order and promised to deliver it on time.

Than after half an hour another call came from the restaurant team claiming the order will get delay by half an hour due to some circumstances,we gladly accepted and said its okay we understand the problem. Than after half an hour again call came stating issues with delivery boy.The order got delayed by 2 hours whereas it takes only 13mins from Indiranagar to kormangala that is where we stay. We had to throw away almost half the food coz everything became hard to chew and birthday celebration went to a toss.

And on top of that when we received the food it was iced cold , we couldnt reheat it as the kebabs and all were very hard already.
We called the Barbecue Nation and spoke to their manager and he said he is sorry and as a compensation he will deliver the same order tomorrow that is 16th October 2021.

He called in the evening and said as promised we are sending the kebab box whereas in my previous order we had prawns and corn included as well. We denied it as we wanted either a full refund or full order replacement.But we didnt got anything.The manager was offering only biryani box which was not justified at all.

I just want to know is this the way Barbeque Nation works?This is pathetic service . Even in Zomato and Swiggy if the food is late they issue a full refund or order replacement.But here only half part of order was been offered. I was a loyal customer to Barbeque Nation and my friends,family too. But now we have decided not to ever visit Barbeque nation again or order any food from there. 

You guys wasted my birthday plan
I totally regret now placing a order and waisting my hard earned money. Its really disgusting and the customer care is crap , there was no compensation at all .It doesnt suits a giant restaurant chain like Barbeque Nation to act this way .You will lose many valuable customers with this attitude.",neutral,0.5

So we reached at 3.30 and were told that at 4.30 we will get our seat. We stood there and saw they are only prioritizing the people who had booking whereas we are told that no booking is accepted. We stood there for 1.5 hours and then were told that if we are oklay with shared seats they can serve us. Otherwise there's no chance at that moment. People coming 1 hour after us were going in as they had booking. So what is the meaning of First come first serve if you are taking bookings??

We were asking if any grilled food will be available as one of us is having gastric problems.Instead of dealing it properly the perrson started telling whatever you eat you need to pay 1100rs.And his behaviour was extremely rude.

C0103,Tejeshwar Siddem,P0103,BarbequeNation,"Hi Team Barbecue Nation,

I have an idea or suggestion to reduce waiting time in your Restaurants.

Today I visited Barbecue Nation in kothaguda, As I didn't get the pre-booking and I asked manager if I can get a table but he said it is not possible without pre-booking and he also shown an example of a customer who booked a table @12 pm but They are still waiting untill 1:30 pm and I decided to get a take away order and booked it.  It should be ready by 2:30pm as they mentioned in Barbecue Nation application but It was also delayed and got ready @3:15 pm ofcourse manager was nice and I see him really struggling to accommodate the dine-in customers. 

So, I got an idea which I want to share you:

you give an opportunity to the dine-in customers to limit their stay time and help next customers to enjoy their time by, a lucky draw scheme.

How?

If a customer enjoy their meal and leave the restaurant in a particular amout of time(ie, 45 mins or 60 mins), then that customer are eligible to a luck draw

This lucky draw winners will be announced every day.

everyday there should be 3 winners

The prize can be a barbecue grill box or barbecue box which will be delivered to their home or they can pick up the order at outlet 

I think you can try this once and observe how the results will be..

worth giving a try than not trying it with -ve assumptions!!

To me the excitement contained till the food was eaten by family.

Other than the excitement to open the box and further little compartments into it there was nothing else. 

Food quality absolutely LOW or MINUS maybe. Chicken biryani looked previous day leftover as itvwas fuming with smell when opened and had to be dumped. Grilled non veg pieces also were of a similar taste.

I am Parul from Delhi. 

We are regular n loyal customers of barbeque nation since ages. 

We have been regularly going to your outlets at various locations like Janakpuri, Ambience Island, gurgaon both on personal n professional front despite other barbeque good brands have come up now.We visited Vegas Mall outlet on 6th March'2021 for dinner

We went there for family outing and celebration but irony we faced lot of humiliation.We visited before lockdown n had very bitter experience.The staff refused to offer us any seating ,despite there were seats available.On continuous request,they actually pushed us in one of the corners in very little space.Our daughter during all thus chaos burnt her finger.It was a horrible experience and all the time we were there,our daughter kept crying..we hardly ate anything

Barbeque over the years lost its respect,roots with which it started.Lack of customer care,unfriendly attitude,worst communication...n lot more

Recently on 6 th march we booked a slot of 7:00 to 9:00 pm.We reached there and the staff was reluctant to give gud seating.After telling bad experience we had last time Mr.Birendre gave us some seating where we adjusted.

We asked for veg buffet and gave them vouchers of dine out offer under GIRF 2021.Mr DEEPAK KUMAR refused to accept and refused to share restaurant pin and asked us to leave.On asking to give pin and reason ,he said we can't give them dine out vouchers as its valid for 10 guest or more.And he forced us to see terms and conditions..rather showing us and telling the facts.He humiliated,insulted,and lied on dine out terms and conditions ,which never stated this.We have been participating in the same and day before we dined at CAFE DELHI HEIGHTS which offered hassle less,amazing services.

Mr DEEPAK KUMAR wasted our time.We came at 7:00 and it took an hour he stated baseless things and humiliated me,who is a lady with small kid.We were trapped as we bought vouchers ..n couldn't go anywhere else to have dinner.Mr Deepak Kumar totally failed to understand the basics of customer service,experience..and spoiled our dinner .Once again Barbeque Nation dissapointed us.

It was a birthday celebrations n I was accompanied by a child.Our whole dinner plan was wasted. We were tired n ended up spoiling our time, money n energy. 

I am shocked how can a brand like barbeque nation do like that. It took me few days to come out of shock given by Barbeque nation,so am writing today.It caused lot of anxiety and stress,humiliation to us ...as we planned early dinner celebration..after an year of lockdown..that too in newly opened outlet in Dwarka Vegas mall.And the food quality and taste was not gud at all..the starters were dry and salty .The main course was too salty.So it was a complete failure and disaster.

Immediate attention is required. 

Thanks

Barbeque Nation worst buffet I have ever had...

1. You should mention the actual dishes in the menu on your website that you are going to serve to the customer(they served aalu tickki as kabab) and the cherry on cake is they serve cold food.

2. Worst service - They don't have any specific waiters for tables(I asked so many different waiters for the same dish again and again, but it seems like they didn't even care). I kept waiting for 30 minutes for my starters and again 30 minutes for the main course.

3. Worst deserts, worst kulfi (which is Barbeque Nation's speciality what I heard). It seems like I was having a kulfi made up of water.

And I know you guys are don't even care about the customer's complaints because you are getting your payments.

Total waste of money(?599+GST)

So here is a big Thanks for your worst services.

C0197,Shivangi Sinha,P0197,BarbequeNation,"Barbeque Nation, as the name suggests, serves a wide range of barbecued items. We (a friend and I) turned up at their Jangpura branch during an ongoing Kabab festival, which started on February 28th and continued till March 8th, 2015. They are using this event to promote their latest feather on the cap ""Kulfi Nation"" as well.

Jangpura branch of Barbeque Nation is strategically located in the ground floor of Eros Cinema Building, at a walking distance of just 5 minutes from the Jangpura metro station.

The entrance has been specially adorned for the Kabab Festival. A small path leads us to the delightfully decorated dining area. Each table has its own charcoal basket to keep the food warm and six different bowls of sauces to choose from. Also theres a small flag, a typical BBQ nation custom, which needs to be put down when you want to discontinue receiving starters and move on to the main course.

Being hardcore non-vegetarians, we straightaway went for the ""Kabab Garh Mansahari"" starter dishes. We began with Teen Mirchi Jheenga. Apparent from its name, it is prawn marinated with three types of chilies: red chili, green chili and black pepper. No, it is not that spicy as you may think, nonetheless it titillates your taste buds.

Next was Hariyali Murg Boti Kabab, which is barbecued chicken marinated with coriander leaves and Indian spices. It was soft and tender to savor. Next we had Gilaafi Seekh, which is nothing but mutton seekh kabab. It goes very well with mint chutney. Now it was time for trying something new. We successively had two recently introduced items: Achari Murg Pankhuri and Bharwan Murg Tangri. 

Let me tell the readers that they have launched few new items in this kabob festival. Eventually they are planning to keep all/some of them depending on the feedback received. Achari Murg Pankhuri is chicken wings marinated with tandoori spices with an added achari flavour. I would say they should roll out this luscious item on a permanent basis. However, Bharwa Murg Tangri, stuffed chicken leg was a bit disappointing. Perhaps they added too little spice for my taste. The fish item, Mughlai Tali Machi, batter fried basa fish, was decent but nothing extraordinary.

At this juncture, we were mostly happy with the food, but there was nothing miraculous. The turning point in our experience was when we decided to explore the vegetarian dishes. Our surprise journey started with Karela Kabab, yes that ugly bitter gourd I have hated since my childhood. They made it pleasant-tasting. You should try it with the sweet mango pulp chutney. The managing personal mentioned that they especially order smaller size karela for this dish, which are not that bitter.

Then we had a piece of Hara-bhara Kabab. These small crisp kabobs, stuffed with peas, fenugreek etc., made us realize that vegetarian kababs can be palatable for hard-core non vegetarians too. Although we were replete by now, we wanted to try a little bit of everything. So we asked for Chatpata fruit kabab, Kurkure Thal-e kabab and Aloo Mongolian. A glimpse of innovation and skill of the master chef was apparent in almost all the vegetarian dishes. The sweet taste of pineapple in Chatpata fruit kabab was a good taste breaker. They also provided a small portion of specially made sweet naan as a complimentary taste breaker. When you are continuously having spicy dishes, this staple with the aroma of kesar and pista gives a relief to your palate, though the bread could be softer. Kurkure Thal-e kabab was fried vegetables stirred with onion and coriander. 

Aloo Mongolian was Chinese style potato fry and decent in taste. Well, a vegetarian meal stands incomplete if you do not try any paneer dish. The juicy Paneer Achari was a teaser to our taste-buds. We concluded our starter meal on a high note with few pieces of Teekha Kumbh, mushroom marinated with hot spices. Their master chef mentioned they put in a lot of effort to enhance the vegetarian dishes and this was very evident from the taste.

Unlike the starter dishes, they serve main courses in a buffet system. The master chef mentioned that most of their visitors directly go for dessert on completion of starters instead of exploring main courses. However, he particularly requested us to have Nizam fish curry. He explained how they painstakingly smash the fishes into small pieces before marinating and frying them. Then they are cooked in a curry made of secret spices. It was worth trying. I also tasted Nizami Biriyani, which had a wonderful aroma of Indian spices but could have been better taste-wise. Interesting to note, in spite of being named after the Nizam, it was nothing like Hyderabadi biriyani, in fact it was the less spicy version of Kolkata Biriyani (without potatoes).

Now we quickly move on to the dessert items: we had a wide range of options. We started with Khajur ki Barfi and Ghewar. Khajur ki Barfi was a bit sweeter for my taste, but Ghewar was great. The two must try desserts are Shahi Khurma and Gulkand Firni. Gulkand Firni is something they are serving for the very first time, the flavour of Gulkund with a perfect balance of sugar gave a nice touch to this dish made of coarse rice and milk, making it my favourite dessert Unfortunately our stomach was too full to try something more as we did not want to miss out on the opportunity to crave into the Kulfi Nation, the icy cool new neighbor of Barbeque Nation.

Kulfi Nation is an amazing addition to Barbeque Nation. From now on a visit there would be incomplete if you do not taste their Kulfis. We started with good old Kulfi-Falooda-Rabadi topped with Rooh Afza. Wonderful will be an understatement for it. Kulfi of this quality is very rare even in the best kulfi corners of Old Delhi. Apart from Kulfi-Faluda, they have five other major varieties. We tried pan-kulfi with rabadi & gulkand and strawberry kulfi. The strawberry kulfi was the best amongst the three. We were fascinated to know that they have around 800 different toppings for Kulfi.

Overall it was a marvelous dinner experience in a delightful ambiance. It broke one of my big stereotype notions as well: Barbeque Nation, already known as a heaven for non-vegetarians, is a messiah for vegetarians too. Also, the management deserves a special credit for coming up with the idea of Kabab festival, which gave us the chance to try a whole new array of dishes.",neutral,0.5
